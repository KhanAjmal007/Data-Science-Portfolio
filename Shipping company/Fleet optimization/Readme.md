The fleet optimization project for a shipping company would involve several steps and require specific data inputs in order to develop an effective model. Here is an example of how such a project could be approached:

    Data collection: Gather data on the shipping fleet including vessel information such as vessel name, vessel type, cargo capacity, fuel consumption, etc. Gather data on the ports such as location, cargo loading and unloading capacity, etc. Gather data on the routes such as distance, weather conditions, etc.

    Data preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the data in order to prepare it for modeling. This may include filling in missing values, removing outliers, and converting data into a format that can be easily used by the model.

    Model development: Develop a model that can optimize the routes, schedules, and logistics of the shipping fleet. This can be done using various optimization techniques such as linear programming, mixed-integer programming, or heuristics.

    Model evaluation: Evaluate the model using a set of metrics such as fuel consumption, cargo capacity utilization, and time efficiency.

    Deployment: Deploy the model on the shipping fleet and monitor the performance.

Code example:

    # Import necessary libraries
    import pandas as pd
    from scipy.optimize import linprog

    # Read the data
    fleet_data = pd.read_csv('fleet_data.csv')
    port_data = pd.read_csv('port_data.csv')
    route_data = pd.read_csv('route_data.csv')

    # Define the objective function and constraints
    c = [fuel_consumption, cargo_capacity_utilization, time_efficiency]
    A = [[route_data, port_data, fleet_data]]
    b = [constraints]
    x0_bounds = (routes, schedules, logistics)

    # Optimize the model
    res = linprog(c, A_ub=A, b_ub=b, A_eq=Aeq, b_eq=beq, bounds=bnds, method='simplex')

    # Print the optimized routes, schedules and logistics
    print(res.x)

    # Make predictions on new data
    new_data = pd.read_csv('new_shipping_data.csv')
    predictions = model.predict(new_data)

The outcome of this project would be an optimized fleet plan that minimizes costs while maximizing efficiency. This can include routes, schedules, and logistics that take into account factors such as fuel consumption, cargo capacity, and weather conditions. The model can also be used to make predictions on new data and continuously improve the fleet plan over time. In order to work on a demo, you can use historical data from a shipping company, such as vessel routes, fuel consumption, cargo capacity, and weather data. This data can be obtained through various sources, such as the company's website, publicly available datasets, or by contacting the company directly.
