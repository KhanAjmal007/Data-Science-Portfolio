To develop a system for supply chain visibility, data on the location and status of cargo would need to be collected from various sources such as shipping manifests, GPS tracking data, and sensor data from the cargo itself. This data could then be used to build a real-time dashboard or map that shows the location and status of all cargo in the supply chain.

Here's an example of how such a system could be built using Python and the Pandas library for data manipulation and the Plotly library for creating interactive visualizations:

    # Import the necessary libraries
    import pandas as pd
    import plotly.express as px

    # Read in the data
    data = pd.read_csv('supply_chain_data.csv')

    # Create a map that shows the current location of all cargo
    fig = px.scatter_mapbox(data, lat='latitude', lon='longitude', color='status',
                           size='weight', hover_name='cargo_id', zoom=3)
    fig.show()

In this example, the input data is a CSV file that includes the following columns:

    cargo_id: A unique identifier for each piece of cargo
    latitude: The latitude of the cargo's current location
    longitude: The longitude of the cargo's current location
    status: The current status of the cargo (e.g. "in transit", "delivered", "held at customs")
    weight: The weight of the cargo

The outcome of the system would be an interactive map that shows the location and status of all cargo in the supply chain. The map would allow users to zoom in and out, hover over individual pieces of cargo to see more information, and filter the data based on status or other attributes.

To work on a demo project, one could use sample datasets of shipping routes, cargo information, and tracking data to simulate the movement of cargo through the supply chain. The input data could include information such as the origin and destination of cargo, the type of cargo, and any relevant tracking information such as GPS coordinates and sensor data. The outcome of the project would be a real-time visibility system that allows the user to track the location and status of cargo at any point in the supply chain. This can be achieved by using technologies like IoT and big data analytics to process and visualize the data in real-time. To develop the demo, one could start by building a data pipeline to collect and process the data, then use machine learning algorithms to analyze the data and make predictions about the location and status of cargo. The final step would be to develop a user interface that allows the user to interact with the system and view the real-time data.
