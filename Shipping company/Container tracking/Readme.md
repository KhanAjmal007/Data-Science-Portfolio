To develop a container tracking system, the following steps can be taken:

    Collect data on container location and condition using IoT devices such as GPS and sensors. This data can include information on the container's location, temperature, humidity, and any potential damage.

    Preprocess the data by cleaning and formatting it for use in a machine learning model. This may include removing missing or duplicate data and converting data into a format that can be used by the model.

    Train a machine learning model to predict the location and condition of containers based on the data collected. This can include using techniques such as supervised learning, unsupervised learning or deep learning.

    Test the model on a set of unseen data to evaluate its performance and make any necessary adjustments.

    Implement the model in a real-time tracking system that can be accessed by relevant parties such as shipping companies and customs officials.

Code example:

    # Import necessary libraries
    import pandas as pd
    from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
    from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
    from sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error

    # Read in the data
    data = pd.read_csv('container_data.csv')

    # Preprocess the data
    data = data.dropna()

    # Split the data into training and testing sets
    train_data, test_data = train_test_split(data, test_size = 0.2)

    # Train the model
    model = RandomForestRegressor()
    model.fit(train_data[['latitude', 'longitude', 'temperature', 'humidity']], train_data['condition'])

    # Make predictions on the test set
    predictions = model.predict(test_data[['latitude', 'longitude', 'temperature', 'humidity']])

    # Evaluate the model's performance
    mae = mean_absolute_error(y_test, y_pred)
    print("Mean Absolute Error:", mae)
    Save the model

    joblib.dump(model, 'container_tracking_model.pkl')
    Use the model to make predictions on new data

    new_data = pd.read_csv('new_container_data.csv')
    new_data = scaler.transform(new_data)
    new_predictions = model.predict(new_data)

Deploy the model in a web service or as a part of a larger system for tracking containers in real-time
Note: This is a very high-level example and there are many details that would need to be considered when actually building a real-world container tracking system. For example, it would be important to take into account factors such as security, scalability, and data privacy. The code provided here is for demonstration purposes only and should not be used in a production environment without proper testing and modification.
