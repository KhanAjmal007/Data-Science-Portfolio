Predictive modeling is a technique that uses machine learning algorithms to predict a specific outcome or target variable based on a set of input features. One example of this is using predictive modeling to predict customer churn in a retail industry.

Step 1: Data collection and preparation

    Collect customer data, including demographic information, transaction history, and customer feedback.
    Prepare the data by cleaning, normalizing, and transforming it as necessary.
    Label the data by identifying which customers have churned and which have not.

Step 2: Feature selection

    Select the most relevant features to include in the model by using techniques such as correlation analysis, chi-squared test, and mutual information.

Step 3: Model selection and training

    Select an appropriate machine learning algorithm for the problem, such as logistic regression, decision tree, or random forest.
    Train the model on the labeled data using a suitable library such as scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or Keras.

Step 4: Model evaluation

    Evaluate the performance of the model by using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
    Tune the model by adjusting the hyperparameters, if necessary.

Step 5: Deployment

    Deploy the model in a production environment, where it can be used to predict customer churn for new customers.

Here is an example of the code for training a logistic regression model using scikit-learn:
    
    from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
    from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
    from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

    # Load the data and select features
    X = ...
    y = ...

    # Split the data into training and testing sets
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

    # Initialize the model
    logreg = LogisticRegression()

    # Train the model on the training data
    logreg.fit(X_train, y_train)

    # Predict on the test data
    y_pred = logreg.predict(X_test)

    # Evaluate the model
    accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
    print("Accuracy: ", accuracy)
    
In this example, the data needs to be loaded and the target variable (customer churn) and input features should be identified. The data is then split into training and testing sets, and the logistic regression model is initialized. The model is then trained on the training data, and predictions are made on the test data. The model's performance is then evaluated using the accuracy metric, which compares the predicted values to the true values in the test set. 
As for the data sets to be used as input, it can be collected from the retail industry customer's transactional history, demographic information and feedback. The outcome variable would be whether the customer churned or not. 

It's worth noting that this is just one example of how predictive modeling can be applied in the retail industry, and the specific data sets and algorithms used will depend on the problem at hand. It's important to always consider the specific requirements of the problem, as well as the available data, when developing a predictive model.
