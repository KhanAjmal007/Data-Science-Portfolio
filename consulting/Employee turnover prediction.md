"
Employee turnover prediction: Develop a model that predicts which employees are at risk of leaving the company based on data such as job performance, engagement, and demographics.
"

One way to approach this project would be to use a supervised machine learning algorithm such as logistic regression or decision trees. The steps to complete this project would be as follows:

    Data collection: Gather data on current employees, including demographic information (age, gender, etc.), job performance metrics, engagement scores, and whether or not the employee has left the company.

    Data cleaning: Clean and preprocess the data, handling any missing or duplicate values, and converting categorical variables into numerical ones if necessary.

    Feature selection: Select relevant features to include in the model, such as job performance, engagement scores, and demographic information.

    Model training: Use a supervised machine learning algorithm to train the model on the data. The goal is to predict if an employee is at risk of leaving the company or not.

    Model evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.

    Model deployment: Use the model to predict which employees are at risk of leaving the company, and take appropriate action such as offering training or incentives to retain those employees.

An example code for this project using Python would be:

    # Import necessary libraries
    import pandas as pd
    from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
    from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
    from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, precision_score, recall_score

    # Load and preprocess the data
    data = pd.read_csv("employee_data.csv")
    data = data.dropna()
    data = pd.get_dummies(data, columns=["department", "gender"])

    # Select relevant features
    X = data[["performance", "engagement", "age", "gender_male", "department_sales"]]
    y = data["left_company"]

    # Split the data into training and testing sets
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)

    # Train the model
    model = LogisticRegression()
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)

    # Make predictions on the test set
    y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

    # Evaluate the model
    accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
    precision = precision_score(y_test, y_pred)
    recall = recall_score(y_test, y_pred)

    print("Accuracy:", accuracy)
    print("Precision:", precision)
    print("Recall:", recall)
