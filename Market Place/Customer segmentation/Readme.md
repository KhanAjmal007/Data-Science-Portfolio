Step 1: Data collection and preprocessing

    Collect customer data from various sources such as purchase history, browsing behavior, and surveys.
    Clean and preprocess the data to handle missing or inconsistent data, and to ensure that all relevant variables are in a format that can be used for analysis.

Step 2: Feature Engineering

    Extract relevant features from the raw data such as purchase frequency, average order value, and product categories frequently purchased.
    Use these features to create a new dataset that can be used for analysis

Step 3: Modeling

    Use unsupervised learning techniques such as K-means or hierarchical clustering to segment customers into different groups based on their behavior and preferences.
    Use visualization techniques such as PCA or t-SNE to create a low-dimensional representation of the data and visualize the clusters

Step 4: Model evaluation

    Evaluate the performance of the model using metrics such as silhouette score or within-cluster sum of squares
    Refine the model by adjusting the number of clusters or the features used

Step 5: Deployment

    Use the segmented customer data to create targeted marketing campaigns, such as personalized product recommendations or targeted email promotions.

Code sample:

    from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
    from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

    # Scale the data
    scaler = StandardScaler()
    data_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(data)

    # Create the kmeans object
    kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=5)

    # Fit the k-means object to the data
    kmeans.fit(data_scaled)

    # Get the cluster assignments
    clusters = kmeans.predict(data_scaled)

The input data set is customer's behavior data, it should include features such as purchase history, browsing behavior and surveys. The output is a clustering of customers based on their behavior and preferences.
