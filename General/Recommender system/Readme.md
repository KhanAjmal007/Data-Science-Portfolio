A Recommender system is a technique that suggests products, content, or other items to users based on their past behavior and preferences. One example of a recommender system project is suggesting products to customers on an e-commerce platform.

Step 1: Data collection

    Collect data on customer interactions with the e-commerce platform, such as product views, purchases, and ratings.

Step 2: Data preprocessing

    Preprocess the data by cleaning and normalizing it as necessary.

Step 3: Model selection

    Select an appropriate algorithm for the problem, such as collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, or hybrid methods.

Step 4: Model training

    Train the model on the collected data using a suitable library such as scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or Keras.

Step 5: Model evaluation

    Evaluate the performance of the model by using metrics such as precision, recall, and F1 score.
    Tune the model by adjusting the hyperparameters, if necessary.

Step 6: Deployment

    Deploy the model in a production environment, where it can be used to suggest products to new customers.

Here is an example of the code for creating a collaborative filtering recommendation system using the LightFM library in Python:

    from lightfm import LightFM
    from lightfm.datasets import fetch_movielens
    from lightfm.evaluation import precision_at_k

    # Load the data
    data = fetch_movielens(min_rating=4.0)

    # Split the data into training and testing sets
    train, test = train_test_split(data)

    # Initialize the model
    model = LightFM(loss='warp')

    # Train the model on the training data
    model.fit(train)

    # Make recommendations for a set of users
    user_ids = ...
    item_ids = ...
    scores = model.predict(user_ids, item_ids)

    # Evaluate the model
    precision = precision_at_k(model, test, k=10)
    print("Precision: ", precision)
    
In this example, the data set used is the customer interactions data with the e-commerce platform, such as product views, purchases, and ratings. The model is a collaborative filtering method, using the 'warp' loss function from LightFM library. The model is trained and then used to make recommendations for a set of user_ids and item_ids, which is then evaluated using the precision@k metric, where k is the number of recommended items.

It's worth noting that this is just one example of how a recommender system can be applied on e-commerce platforms, and the specific data sets and algorithms used will depend on the problem at hand. Additionally, in practice, more advanced techniques such as matrix factorization, deep learning and hybrid methods can be implemented to improve the performance of the recommender system, and also more data would be needed to be collected as well as more preprocessing and feature engineering steps will be applied to make the model more accurate.
