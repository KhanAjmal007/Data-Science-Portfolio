Churn prediction for utility customers: Develop a model that predicts which customers are likely to leave a utility company, allowing for targeted retention efforts.

To work on a demo project for churn prediction for utility customers, one could use a sample dataset of customer information, such as demographics, billing history, and usage data. The goal of the project would be to train a machine learning model to predict which customers are likely to cancel their service.

    Step 1: Collect and prepare the data. This includes cleaning and preprocessing the dataset, such as handling missing values, converting categorical variables to numerical, and splitting the data into training and testing sets.

    Step 2: Select and train a machine learning model. A suitable model for this task could be a binary classification model, such as logistic regression or a decision tree.

    Step 3: Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

    Step 4: Use the model to make predictions on the test dataset and compare the predicted outcome with the actual outcome.

    Step 5: Optimize the model's performance by tuning its parameters or trying different algorithms.

Here is an example code for this project using logistic regression:

    import pandas as pd
    from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
    from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
    from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, precision_score, recall_score, f1_score

    # Load the dataset
    data = pd.read_csv('customer_data.csv')

    # Preprocess the data
    data = data.dropna()
    data = pd.get_dummies(data, columns=['gender', 'state'])

    # Split the data into training and testing sets
    X = data.drop(['customer_id', 'churn'], axis=1)
    y = data['churn']
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)

    # Build the logistic regression model
    model = LogisticRegression()
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)
    
    # Evaluate the model on the test data

    y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
    accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
    print(f'Accuracy: {accuracy}')
    
    # Output feature importance

    coef = model.coef_
    print(f'Feature importance: {coef}')
    
    # Use the model to predict the probability of churn for a new customer

    new_customer = [[35, 'M', 3, 'Premium']]
    new_customer_proba = model.predict_proba(new_customer)
    print(f'Probability of churn for new customer: {new_customer_proba[0][1]}')
    
    # Use the model to make a prediction for a new customer

    new_customer_pred = model.predict(new_customer)
    print(f'Prediction for new customer: {new_customer_pred}')

To work on a demo project, one could use a sample dataset of utility customer information such as age, gender, number of years as a customer, and service plan type. The outcome of the model would be a prediction of whether or not a customer is likely to leave the company, represented as a probability value or a binary value (churn/not churn). Additionally, feature importance can be analyzed to understand which factors are most influential in determining churn. This information can be used to target retention efforts to customers who are at the highest risk of leaving.
