Energy consumption prediction: Develop a model that predicts future energy consumption based on historical data and external factors such as weather and demand.

To work on a demo project for energy consumption prediction, one could use a sample dataset of historical energy consumption data along with external factors such as weather and demand. The data should include information such as the date and time of energy consumption, the amount of energy consumed, and any relevant external factors.

Here's an example of a code that uses a Random Forest Regressor to predict energy consumption:

    # Import libraries
    from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
    from sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error
    from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

    # Load the data
    data = pd.read_csv("energy_data.csv")

    # Split the data into features and target
    X = data.drop("energy_consumed", axis=1)
    y = data["energy_consumed"]

    # Split the data into train and test sets
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

    # Train the model
    model = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100)
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)

    # Make predictions on the test set
    y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

    # Evaluate the model's performance
    mae = mean_absolute_error(y_test, y_pred)
    print(f'Mean Absolute Error: {mae}')

In this example, the input dataset includes historical energy consumption data and external factors such as weather and demand. The model, a Random Forest Regressor, is trained on a portion of the data (80%) and then used to make predictions on the remaining portion of the data (20%). The input dataset for this project would include historical energy consumption data as well as external factors such as weather and demand data. The outcome of the project would be the ability to make accurate predictions of future energy consumption based on this input data.

Here is an example code for implementing this project:

    import pandas as pd
    from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
    from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
    from sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error

    # Load the data
    data = pd.read_csv("energy_data.csv")

    # Split the data into features and target variables
    X = data.drop("energy_consumption", axis=1)
    y = data["energy_consumption"]

    # Split the data into training and test sets
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

    # Train the model
    model = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100)
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)

    # Make predictions on the test set
    y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

    # Evaluate the model's performance
    mae = mean_absolute_error(y_test, y_pred)
    print(f'Mean Absolute Error: {mae}')

To work on a demo project, one could use a sample energy consumption dataset that includes data for a specific time period (e.g. 1 year) and a limited number of external factors (e.g. temperature and demand data for a specific region). The goal would be to train the model on this sample data and use it to make predictions for future energy consumption. As the model's performance is evaluated, the external factors can be expanded and more data can be added to improve the accuracy of the predictions.

    Gather historical data on energy consumption, including factors such as date and time, weather conditions, and demand levels. This data can be obtained from internal company records or publicly available sources.

    Clean and preprocess the data to ensure that it is in a format that can be used for modeling. This may include handling missing values, converting data types, and normalizing numerical variables.

    Split the data into a training set (80%) and a test set (20%) to evaluate the model's performance.

    Build the model using a machine learning algorithm such as a Random Forest Regressor. This algorithm is well suited for this task because it can handle non-linear relationships and handle large amounts of data with many features.

    Train the model on the training set.

    Use the model to make predictions on the test set and evaluate its performance using metrics such as mean absolute error and R-squared.

    Fine-tune the model by adjusting parameters and trying different algorithms until the desired level of accuracy is achieved.

    Use the final model to make predictions on new data and use the results to inform decision making and improve energy consumption.

Code:

    # Import necessary libraries
    import pandas as pd
    from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
    from sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error, r2_score
    from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

    # Load the data
    data = pd.read_csv("energy_consumption.csv")

    # Split the data into features and target
    X = data.drop("energy_consumption", axis=1)
    y = data["energy_consumption"]

    # Split the data into training and test sets
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

    # Build the model
    model = RandomForestRegressor()

    # Train the model
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)

    # Make predictions on the test set
    y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

    # Evaluate the model's performance
    mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
    r2 = r2_score(y_test, y_pred)
    print(f'Mean Squared Error (MSE): {mse}')
    print(f'R-squared score: {r2}')

    # Check the distribution of the residuals

    residuals = y_test - y_pred
    plt.hist(residuals, bins=20)
    plt.xlabel("Residual value")
    plt.ylabel("Count")
    plt.show()

    # Compare the predicted and actual values

    plt.scatter(y_pred, y_test)
    plt.xlabel("Predicted Energy Consumption")
    plt.ylabel("Actual Energy Consumption")
    plt.show()

    # Use the model to make predictions on new data

    X_new = ????? # new data for which energy consumption needs to be predicted
    y_new_pred = model.predict(X_new)
    print(f'Predicted energy consumption: {y_new_pred}')

    # Use the model to optimize energy consumption and costs

    X_optimize = ????? # data for which energy consumption needs to be optimized
    y_optimize_pred = model.predict(X_optimize)
    print(f'Optimized energy consumption: {y_optimize_pred}')

    # Implement the model in production

The model can be implemented in the company's systems to predict energy consumption in real-time and optimize energy usage and costs.
