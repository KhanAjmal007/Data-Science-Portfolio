Predictive modeling for power pricing: Develop a model that predicts power prices based on factors such as supply, demand, and weather.

To work on a demo project for predictive modeling of power prices, one could use a sample dataset containing historical power prices, weather data, and demand data.

Here is an example code for building a linear regression model:

    # Import the necessary libraries
    import pandas as pd
    from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
    from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
    from sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error

    # Load the dataset
    df = pd.read_csv('power_pricing_data.csv')

    # Select the features and target variable
    X = df[['temperature', 'demand', 'supply']]
    y = df['price']

    # Split the data into train and test sets
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)

    # Build the linear regression model
    model = LinearRegression()
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)

    # Make predictions on the test set
    y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

    # Evaluate the model's performance
    mae = mean_absolute_error(y_test, y_pred)
    print(f'Mean Absolute Error: {mae}')

The input dataset should contain historical power prices, weather data (e.g. temperature), demand data and supply data. The outcome of the model would be the predicted power prices.

One could also try different algorithms such as Random Forest Regressor or XGBoost to see which one performs better on the dataset.

The model's performance can be evaluated using metrics such as mean absolute error, mean squared error and r-squared score.

To work on a demo project, one could use a sample dataset and test the model's performance using the above-mentioned metrics. One can also tune the model's hyperparameters to see if it improves the performance of the model.

    Gather and clean the data: Collect data on power prices, supply and demand, weather, and any other relevant factors. Clean the data by handling missing values, removing outliers, and ensuring that the data is in a format that can be used for training a model.

    Feature engineering: Create new features from the existing data that may be useful for the model. For example, you could create a feature that represents the average temperature over the past week.

    Split the data: Divide the data into training and test sets, typically using 80% of the data for training and 20% for testing.

    Build the predictive model: Using the training data, build a model that can predict power prices based on the input factors. You could use a regression model such as Random Forest or XGBoost.

    Evaluate the model: Use the test data to evaluate the performance of the model. Metrics such as mean absolute error or mean squared error can be used to measure the accuracy of the model.

    Fine-tune the model: Based on the evaluation results, fine-tune the model by adjusting its parameters or trying different algorithms.

    Implement the model: Once the model has been fine-tuned, it can be implemented and used to make predictions on new data.

    Monitor the model: Continuously monitor the model's performance and update it as necessary based on new data or changes in the underlying factors.

In terms of data sets, you could use data from power grid operators or energy markets, historical weather data, and economic indicators such as GDP. The outcome would be predictions of power prices that can be used for forecasting and decision making.
