One approach to a predictive maintenance project for a power and energy utilities company would be to use machine learning techniques to analyze sensor data from equipment and predict when it is likely to fail.

Here is an example of a Python code that uses a Random Forest Classifier to train a predictive model:

    # Import necessary libraries
    import pandas as pd
    from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
    from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
    from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

    # Read in the data
    data = pd.read_csv('equipment_data.csv')

    # Split the data into features and labels
    X = data.drop('failure', axis=1)
    y = data['failure']

    # Split the data into training and test sets
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)

    # Train the model
    clf = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100)
    clf.fit(X_train, y_train)

    # Make predictions on the test set
    y_pred = clf.predict(X_test)

    # Evaluate the model's performance
    accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
    print(f'Accuracy: {accuracy}')

To work on a demo project, one could use a sample dataset and try to predict when equipment is likely to fail, based on sensor data such as temperature, vibration, pressure, and other relevant factors. The outcome of the model will be a predicted probability of failure for each piece of equipment, which can be used to prioritize maintenance and minimize downtime.

As for the data sets, the inputs would be sensor data from the equipment, along with information about the equipment such as make, model, age, etc. The output would be whether or not the equipment failed within a certain time frame. This data can be collected from the company's internal systems and/or external sources such as equipment manufacturers.

Here is the step by step explanation 

    Gather data on equipment failures and maintenance history. This data should include information on the type of equipment, the date of failure or maintenance, and any relevant sensor data such as temperature or vibration levels.

    Clean and preprocess the data. This may include removing missing values, handling categorical variables, and scaling numerical variables.

    Split the data into training and test sets. This will allow us to evaluate the performance of our model on unseen data.

    Train a predictive model using machine learning techniques such as Random Forest or Gradient Boosting. These models can handle the non-linear relationships between the predictor variables and the target variable.

    Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

    Optimize the model by tuning the hyperparameters and feature selection.

    Finally, use the model to predict equipment failures on new data and schedule maintenance accordingly.

To work on a demo project, one could use a sample dataset from a public source such as the UCI Machine Learning Repository and try different models and tuning the hyperparameters to see the best results.
