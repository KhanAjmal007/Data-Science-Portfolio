Here is an example of how to build an image recognition model using a convolutional neural network (CNN) in Python:

Step 1: Data collection and preprocessing

    Collect a dataset of images of products in the store, along with labels indicating the product category.
    Preprocess the images by resizing and normalizing them.

Step 2: Building the model

    Use a CNN architecture such as VGG or ResNet pre-trained on a large dataset such as ImageNet.
    Fine-tune the model on the store's image dataset.

Step 3: Training the model

    Train the model using the preprocessed images and labels.
    Use techniques such as data augmentation to improve the model's performance.

Step 4: Evaluation

    Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy and F1-score.

Step 5: Deployment

    Deploy the model to a web or mobile application that allows customers to upload images of products and receive product recommendations.

Data sets:

    Common data sets for this type of project include the COCO dataset, the OpenImages dataset, and the Imagenet dataset.

Outcome:

    The model should be able to correctly recognize and classify products in images with high accuracy.
    The deployed application should allow customers to upload images and receive product recommendations in real-time.
    
Here is an example of the code for creating an image recognition model using a convolutional neural network (CNN) in Python using the TensorFlow and Keras libraries:

    # Import necessary libraries
    import tensorflow as tf
    from tensorflow import keras
    from keras.layers import Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, Dense

    # Load the data
    (x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test) = keras.datasets.fashion_mnist.load_data()
    x_train = x_train.reshape(x_train.shape[0], 28, 28, 1)
    x_test = x_test.reshape(x_test.shape[0], 28, 28, 1)

    # Create the model
    model = keras.Sequential()
    model.add(Conv2D(32, kernel_size=(3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28, 1)))
    model.add(MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2, 2)))
    model.add(Flatten())
    model.add(Dense(128, activation='relu'))
    model.add(Dense(10, activation='softmax'))

    # Compile the model
    model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

    # Train the model
    model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=5)

    # Evaluate the model
    test_loss, test_acc = model.evaluate(x_test, y_test)
    print("Test accuracy: ", test_acc)

This example uses the Fashion MNIST dataset, which contains 70,000 grayscale images of clothing items, such as t-shirts, trousers, and bags, each labeled with the name of the item. The model is trained on a subset of the data and its performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy.

Step 1: Data collection and preprocessing: Here, the data is loaded and preprocessed by reshaping it to fit the input shape of the model.

Step 2: Model creation: The model architecture is defined using the Sequential class from Keras and adding layers such as Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten and Dense.

Step 3: Compile the model: The model is compiled with an optimizer, loss function and evaluation metric.

Step 4: Train the model: The model is trained using the fit() function with the training data.

Step 5: Evaluate the model: The model's performance is evaluated on the test data using the evaluate() function.

Step 6: Use the model to make predictions: Once the model is trained and evaluated, it can be used to make predictions on new images.
