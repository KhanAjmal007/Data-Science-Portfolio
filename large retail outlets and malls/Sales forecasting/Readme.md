here are the steps for creating a sales forecasting model for large retail outlets and malls:

Step 1: Data collection and preprocessing

    Collect sales data for a retail outlet, including the date, sales, and any external factors that may affect the sales, such as promotions, holidays, and weather.
    Clean and preprocess the data to handle any missing values, outliers, or any other issues that may affect the model's performance.

Step 2: Data splitting

    Split the data into a train set and a test set. The train set will be used to fit the model and the test set will be used to evaluate the model's performance.

Step 3: Model selection and training

    Select a time series forecasting model that is suitable for the task at hand. In this example, the ARIMA model is used.
    Train the model on the train set.

Step 4: Model evaluation

    Use the model to make predictions on the test set.
    Evaluate the model's performance using a metric such as mean squared error.

Step 5: Model fine-tuning

    Repeat the process of fine-tuning the model, and evaluating its performance until the desired level of accuracy is achieved.

Step 6: Model deployment

    Use the model to make predictions on new, unseen data.

It's important to note that this is just one example of how sales forecasting can be done using time series forecasting, and the specific data sets, algorithms and the fine-tuning steps will depend on the problem at hand. Collaborating with experts in the field of time series forecasting can also provide valuable insights and help to fine-tune the model for maximum performance.

Here is an example of the code for creating a sales forecasting model using the ARIMA algorithm in Python:

    import pandas as pd
    from statsmodels.tsa.arima_model import ARIMA

    # Load the sales data into a pandas dataframe
    data = pd.read_csv("sales_data.csv")

    # Split the data into train and test sets
    train_data = data[:int(len(data)*0.8)]
    test_data = data[int(len(data)*0.8):]

    # Fit the ARIMA model
    model = ARIMA(train_data["sales"], order=(2,1,2))
    model_fit = model.fit()

    # Use the model to make predictions on the test set
    predictions = model_fit.predict(start=len(train_data), end=len(train_data)+len(test_data)-1, typ='levels')

    # Evaluate the model's performance using mean squared error
    from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error
    print("Mean Squared Error: ", mean_squared_error(test_data["sales"], predictions))
    
This example uses a time series sales data, which should include date, sales, and any external factors that may affect the sales like promotions, holidays, and weather. The model is trained on 80% of the data and its performance is evaluated using mean squared error on the remaining 20% of the data. The specific data sets and algorithms used will depend on the problem at hand, collaborating with experts in the field of time series forecasting can also provide valuable insights and help to fine-tune the model for maximum performance.

    Split the data into a train set and a test set. The train set will be used to fit the model and the test set will be used to evaluate the model's performance.

    Fit the ARIMA model using the train set. The ARIMA model is configured with an order of (2,1,2) in this example, but this may need to be adjusted based on the specific data set.

    Use the model to make predictions on the test set.

    Evaluate the model's performance using a metric such as mean squared error.

    Repeat the process of fine-tuning the model, and evaluating its performance until the desired level of accuracy is achieved.
