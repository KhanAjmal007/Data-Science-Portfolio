Step 1: Data collection and preprocessing

    Collect financial news articles from various sources such as news websites, RSS feeds, and social media.
    Preprocess the data by removing irrelevant information, formatting the text, and tokenizing it.

Step 2: Sentiment analysis

    Use natural language processing techniques such as sentiment analysis or text classification to analyze the sentiment of the financial news articles. This can be done using pre-trained models such as BERT or by training a custom model using a labeled dataset.

Step 3: Extract insights

    Extract insights from the sentiment analysis by grouping the articles by stock or industry and analyzing the overall sentiment towards each group.

Code example:

    # Import necessary libraries
    import pandas as pd
    from nltk.sentiment import SentimentIntensityAnalyzer

    # Load the financial news data
    data = pd.read_csv('financial_news.csv')

    # Initialize the sentiment analyzer
    sia = SentimentIntensityAnalyzer()

    # Add a new column to the data with the sentiment scores
    data['sentiment_score'] = data['text'].apply(lambda x: sia.polarity_scores(x)['compound'])

    # Group the data by stock or industry
    grouped_data = data.groupby('stock_or_industry')

    # Calculate the mean sentiment score for each group
    mean_sentiment = grouped_data['sentiment_score'].mean()

    # Print the results
    print(mean_sentiment)

Inputs: Financial news articles in the form of text data
Outputs: Mean sentiment score for each stock or industry

Note: The above example uses NLTK library's SentimentIntensityAnalyzer for sentiment analysis which is based on a lexicon approach, and it can be replaced with any other libraries or models as per your choice.
