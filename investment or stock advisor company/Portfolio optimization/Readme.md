Step 1: Data collection and preprocessing

    Collect historical stock market data on prices, trading volume, and other relevant factors.
    Clean and preprocess the data to handle missing or incomplete values and ensure it is in the appropriate format for analysis.

Step 2: Model development

    Develop a portfolio optimization model using techniques such as mean-variance optimization and Monte Carlo simulations.
    Train the model using the historical stock market data.

Step 3: Model evaluation

    Test the model using out-of-sample data to evaluate its performance in predicting returns and minimizing risk.

Step 4: Model deployment

    Use the optimized portfolio to make investment decisions and monitor its performance over time.

Code example:

from scipy.optimize import minimize
import numpy as np

    # Define the portfolio optimization function
    def optimize_portfolio(returns):
        n = len(returns)
        initial_guess = np.repeat(1/n, n)
        bounds = [(0,1) for x in range(n)]
        def neg_sharpe(weights):
            return -(np.dot(weights, returns).mean()/np.dot(weights, returns).std())
        constraints = ({'type':'eq', 'fun':lambda x: np.sum(x)-1})
        result = minimize(neg_sharpe, initial_guess, bounds=bounds, constraints=constraints)
        return result

    # Collect historical stock market data 
    stock_data = pd.read_csv("stock_data.csv")
    returns = stock_data.pct_change().mean()

    # Optimize the portfolio
    optimized_portfolio = optimize_portfolio(returns)

    # Print the optimized weights
    print(optimized_portfolio.x)

Input data: Historical stock market data including prices, trading volume, and other relevant factors

Output: Optimized portfolio weights that maximizes returns while minimizing risk.
