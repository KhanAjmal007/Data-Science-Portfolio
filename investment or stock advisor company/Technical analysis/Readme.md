Step 1: Data collection and preprocessing

    Collect historical stock price data for the stocks of interest from a reliable source such as Yahoo Finance or Quandl.
    Preprocess the data to handle missing or incomplete data, and to format the data for analysis.

Step 2: Feature engineering

    Use technical analysis indicators such as moving averages, relative strength index (RSI), and Bollinger Bands to extract relevant features from the stock price data.

Step 3: Model training and evaluation

    Train a machine learning model, such as a Random Forest or Gradient Boosting Machine, on the feature-engineered data.
    Evaluate the model using metrics such as accuracy or F1-score.

Step 4: Model deployment

    Use the trained model to make buy or sell recommendations for the stocks in the portfolio.

Code example:

    # Import necessary libraries
    import pandas as pd
    import talib

    # Load stock price data
    df = pd.read_csv('stock_prices.csv')

    # Calculate technical indicators
    df['SMA50'] = talib.SMA(df['Close'], timeperiod=50)
    df['SMA200'] = talib.SMA(df['Close'], timeperiod=200)
    df['RSI'] = talib.RSI(df['Close'], timeperiod=14)
    df['BBUP'], df['BBMID'], df['BBLOW'] = talib.BBANDS(df['Close'])

    # Train and evaluate model
    from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
    from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

    X = df[['SMA50', 'SMA200', 'RSI', 'BBUP', 'BBMID', 'BBLOW']]
    y = (df['Close'] > df['Close'].shift(1)).astype(int)

    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)

    model = RandomForestClassifier()
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)

    print("Accuracy: ", model.score(X_test, y_test))

    # Make predictions on new data
    new_data = pd.read_csv('new_stock_prices.csv')
    predictions = model.predict(new_data)

    # Plot the predictions
    plt.plot(new_data['date'], predictions)
    plt.xlabel('Date')
    plt.ylabel('Predicted Stock Price')
    plt.title('Predicted Stock Prices using Technical Analysis')
    plt.show()

    # Output the results to a CSV file
    results = pd.DataFrame({'date': new_data['date'], 'predicted_price': predictions})
    results.to_csv('technical_analysis_predictions.csv', index=False)

The outcome of this project would be a model that is able to make predictions on future stock prices using technical analysis techniques, and a visual representation of the predictions through a plot. The predictions can also be outputted to a CSV file for further analysis.
