Customer churn prediction: Develop a model that predicts which customers are likely to cancel their service and implement strategies to retain them.

Here is an example of a customer churn prediction model for a telecommunications ISP company:

    Collect and preprocess data: Gather data on customer demographics, service usage, and billing information. Clean and format the data to prepare it for analysis.

    Feature engineering: Create new features based on the existing data, such as the number of months a customer has been with the company or the average monthly bill.

    Build the model: Use machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression or Random Forest to train the model on the data.

    Evaluate the model: Use metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall to evaluate the performance of the model.

    Implement the model: Use the model to predict which customers are likely to cancel their service and implement strategies to retain them.

Code example:

      # Import necessary libraries
      import pandas as pd
      import numpy as np
      from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
      from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
      from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, precision_score, recall_score

      # Load the data
      data = pd.read_csv('customer_data.csv')

      # Create new features
      data['tenure_months'] = data['tenure'] / 30
      data['avg_monthly_bill'] = data['total_bill'] / data['tenure_months']

      # Prepare the data for analysis
      X = data[['tenure_months', 'avg_monthly_bill', 'is_senior_citizen', 'has_partner', 'has_dependents']]
      y = data['churn']

      # Split the data into training and testing sets
      X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)

      # Build the model
      model = LogisticRegression()
      model.fit(X_train, y_train)

      # Make predictions on the test set
      y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

      # Evaluate the model
      acc = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
      prec = precision_score(y_test, y_pred)
      rec = recall_score(y_test, y_pred)
      print(f'Accuracy: {acc}, Precision: {prec}, Recall: {rec}')

      # Implement the model
      churn_predictions = model.predict(X)
      churn_probabilities = model.predict_proba(X)[:,1]

      # Retention strategy implementation
      data['churn_prediction'] = churn_predictions
      data['churn_probability'] = churn_probabilities

      high_risk_customers = data[data['churn_probability'] > 0.7]
      print(high_risk_customers)

      # Implement retention strategy
      #  send retention offers, give loyalty discounts, improve customer service 

This is just one example of how a customer churn prediction model could be implemented for a telecommunications ISP company. The specific data sets, features, and algorithms used will vary depending on the company's unique needs and resources.
