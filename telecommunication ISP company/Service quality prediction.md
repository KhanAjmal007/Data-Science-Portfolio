Service quality prediction: Develop a model that predicts the quality of service for a telecommunications network based on factors such as network usage, traffic patterns, and network capacity.

One example of a project for a telecommunications ISP company that predicts the quality of service for a network could be as follows:

    Data Collection: Collect data on network usage, traffic patterns, and capacity from various sources such as network devices, customer complaints, and survey responses.

    Data Preprocessing: Clean and format the data so that it can be used for the model. This may involve removing missing or irrelevant data, normalizing numerical values, and encoding categorical variables.

    Feature Engineering: Extract relevant features from the data that can be used to predict the quality of service. This may involve calculating metrics such as network usage during peak hours, traffic patterns by device type, and network capacity utilization.

    Model Building: Build a machine learning model such as a Random Forest or XGBoost to predict the quality of service based on the extracted features.

    Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.

    Model Deployment: Deploy the model in a production environment and use it to predict the quality of service for new data.

Here's a sample code for building a Random Forest model for this project:


    # Import necessary libraries
    from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
    from sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error
    from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

    # Load the data
    data = pd.read_csv('network_data.csv')

    # Extract relevant features
    features = ['network_usage', 'traffic_patterns', 'capacity_utilization']
    X = data[features]
    y = data['quality_of_service']

    # Split the data into training and test sets
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

    # Build the Random Forest model
    model = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)

    # Make predictions on the test set
    y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

    # Evaluate the model's performance
    mae = mean_absolute_error(y_test, y_pred)
    print(f'Mean Absolute Error: {mae}')

    # Save the model
    import pickle
    with open('model.pkl', 'wb') as file:
        pickle.dump(model, file)

The input data for this project could be collected from network devices, customer complaints, and survey responses and it should include information about network usage, traffic patterns, and network capacity and the outcome would be the quality of service for the network.
